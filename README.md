# Chatbot Project

This is a simple chatbot project developed using JavaScript and the OpenAI API.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Type messages in the input field and click "Send" to get responses.
4. To switch between using the API and the local JSON file:
   - Set `chatbotapi.js`  in script to use the API.
   - Set `chatbotjson.js` in script to use the JSON file.

## API Usage

If you want to use the OpenAI API:
1. Make a account at openAI website and if you want to use api in a better way then get a premium 
2. Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
3. Create a `chatbotapi.js` file and implement API request logic.
4. If you can't access to api then there is another way which is response.js file where i stored response you can use that by adding chatbotjson.js file in script
